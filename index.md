# An Lámh Dhearg

*The Red Hand rises not in conquest, but in courage.*

A place for the makers, the preservers, and the dreamers.

Built with pride in heritage, love for story, and hands ready to serve.

## Who Am I?

My name is Joseph Foran—**Seosamh Mac Fuartháin** in the old tongue.

This site is a place to gather the works of my hands and heart:  
Projects both personal and shared, reflections drawn from the wisdom of Irish seanfhocail, and perhaps… an invitation.

If you would bear the red hand in spirit—**welcome home**.
